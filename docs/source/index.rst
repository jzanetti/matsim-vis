Welcome to MATSim-VIS
===================================

**MATSim-VIS** is a package that provides many types of diagnostics from the MatSim model. For example:

- agents movements
- the trafic load statistics for links
- the agent travel time 
- mode breakdown for each agent (e.g., car, bicyle or public transpotation)
- policy comparisons

The motivations for developing such a package are:

- To help better understanding MATSim output
- To identify logic errors in the model setup
- To provide a flexible and intuitive way to present the MATSim output

The package is written in *python*, and developed/maintained by Sijin Zhang
